// 1. Why and what is react?

// The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple.It is a single page
// Application, declarative UI, fast performance ,Easy to maintain
// It works only on user interfaces in the application. ReactJS is a JavaScript component
//   library for creating user interfaces for websites and applications.
//    Developed by Jordan Walke in 2011, it sets a new precedent for developing 
//    fast and dynamic websites using JavaScript.


///React users frequently choose functional
// components over class components because
// they are lighter, easier to read and understand,
// and perform better.
// Additionally, functional components can take
// advantage of React hooks, which provide
// powerful state and lifecycle management
// capabilities without the need for class
// components

// In the render() method, we can read props and state and return
//  our JSX code to the root component of our app. In the render()
//   method, we cannot change the state



// 2. Able to use CRA and run the application.

// create-react-app (CRA)



// 5. Conditional rendering.

// In React, conditional rendering is the process of displaying different 
// content based on certain conditions or states. It allows us to create 
// dynamic user interfaces that can adapt to changes in data and user interactions.

// In this process, we can use conditional statements to
//  decide what content should be rendered.

// In React, there are different ways to conditionally render content based
//  on the state of a component or other conditions. 
//  Two common ways are using the ternary operator and the && operator.

// 6. handling basic onClick events.

// 7. Lists in React

// Lists are used to display data in an ordered format and mainly used to display menus on websites.
//  In React, Lists can be created in a similar way as we create lists in JavaScript. 
//  Let us see how we transform Lists in regular JavaScript.

// The map() function is used for traversing the lists. In the below example,
//  the map() function takes an array of numbers and multiply their values with 5.
//   We assign the new array returned by map() to the variable multiplyNums and log it.

// Example
// var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];   
// const multiplyNums = numbers.map((number)=>{   
//     return (number * 5);   
// });   
// console.log(multiplyNums);   
// output
//  [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]

// 8. Difference between global CSS and module.css

// CSS modules are:
// CSS files in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default.

// import styles from "./styles.css";
// element.innerHTML = 
//   `<h1 class="${styles.title}">
//      An example heading
//    </h1>`;

// what is Provider ?

// provider main work is to connect to react js ko redux se connect karna and we install on react-redux library.
// what is store ?

//   we store all data of our app stor ka input reducer and store ka output create stor function.
// what is action ?

//   action is nothing but plane javaScript function.
//   get data from react js.
//   send data to reducer after process.
//   must have type key in return statement.
//   much sync type with reducer.
// what is reducer ?

//   Reducer handle data for store
//   Update data in store
//   Rules:- 1) Need Root-Reducer.
//           2)Reducer must return same value.
//           3)The reducer must have some initial values.
// switch statement in reducer ?
//   this is use for reduce the multi use of if-else in code
// it's look mess so we prefer the switch case there then the if-else
// Get Data in component From Redux ?

//   Make header and Main Component
//   Add image and css
//   Send Data form aAin Component
//   Get data in header component
// what is useSelector and types of uses ?

//   useSelector is react-redux hook
//   and the main work for Selector is to fetch the data from redux to give to react
// what is useSelector?

//   fetch data from redux to react js
//   we can use the useSelector
// Bounce Point
// the flow of the redux :- first reducer take data from action and place in store file. // read about custom hooks
// action and reducer they don't need to import/export the file to each other the connect throw the store


//what is virtual dom in react?
//The virtual dom is an abstrat representation of actual dom, and it is 
//used to increase the performance of updates and rendering of UI
//when a component state changes . React updates the virtual dom, which then calculates
//the difference between the current and previous version of Virtual DOM,
//React then updates only the parts of the actual DOM that have changed instead of 
//re-rendering the the entire tree,resulting in improved performance


// The Shadow DOM is a browser technology designed primarily for
//  scoping variables and CSS in web components.



//React is considered as library or framework?

// React is called as a library because of its behavior of easy to fit into 
// any js environment and doesn't bound user to use things React way,
//It provides a set of tools and functanalities specially for building 
//user Interfaces , but leaves the decision on how to manage state ,structure 
//the overall application , and handle data to the developer .


// 3. Basic understanding of JSX.

// JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension or JavaScript XML) is an extension to JavaScript.
//  It provides an easier way to create UI components in React.
// Hereâ€™s an example of its syntax:

// const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;

//The above code gets transformed in following javascript

//const element=React.createElement("h1",null,"Hello,Word!");

// With JSX, we can write code that looks very similar to HTML or XML, 
// but we have the power of mixing JavaScript
// methods and variables into our code. 
 //Babel(transpiler) takes our jsx code and turns into non jsx code or pure js vanila js  
// code that the UI Framework (React, in this case) can understand.



//React VS Angular

///React is called as a library because of its behavior of easy to fit into 
// any js environment and doesn't bound user to use things React way,
//  while one the other hand Angular is complete MVC (Model View Controller)
//   architecture, and restrict user to follow its pattern of framework.


//In React, data test IDs are often used as a way to target and select
// specific elements for testing purposes. They are attributes added to
// HTML elements to uniquely identify them in test cases.


//Explain Strict Mode in React.

//Identifying components with unsafe lifecycle methods: 
// Certain lifecycle methods are unsafe to use in asynchronous react 
// applications. With the use of third-party libraries, it becomes difficult 
// to ensure that certain lifecycle methods are not used.
// StrictMode helps in providing us with a warning if any of 
// the class components use an unsafe lifecycle method.

//What are Props in react js?
// Props mean properties, which is a way of passing data from parent to child. We can say
// that props are just a communication channel between components. It is always moving
// from parent to child component.

// 4. Difference between State and props.


// Props are used to pass data from one component to another as argument

//props are immutable 
//It can be accessed by the child component omly

// The state is a local data storage that is local to the component only 
// and cannot be passed to other components. 
//state is mutable and can be asynnchronous
//It holds the information about the components
//state cannot be accesssed bt the child components
// The this.setState property or hooks is used to update the state values in the component.


//custom hooks
//Hooks are reusable functions.
// When we have component logic that needs to be used by 
// multiple components, we can extract that logic to a custom Hook.
// Custom Hooks start with "use". Example: useFetch.


//React hooks

//Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features.
// Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.

//Hooks allow us to "hook" into React features such as state and lifecycle methods.

//uaeState    //useState Hook is used to keep track of the application state it allows
//us to manage state in our functional components .It is a way to store data that changes over
//time such as user input or the response from a network request


//what are the different ways a component can be re-rendered in react?
//In React a component can be rerendered in the following ways;

//1 State changes :When the components state changes the component will rerender
//This can happen when setMethod is called ,or when a state
// update is triggered by a custom hook

//2 props changes :when the components props changes the component will re render . This 
//can happen when the parrent component passes a new props to the child component.

//3 context changes : when the context value changes ,components that consume the context will
//re render


//lazy loading?
// clean up function in useEffect?
//pure components
//react fragment 

//stateless and stateful components
//In react ,components can be either class components or functional 
//components

//stateless components also known as functional componnts that receives props and 
//render it to the UI but do not maintain their own state.They are simple and easy 
//to write and are often used  for presaentational purposes

//on the stateful components are components that maintain their own state
//and can update it as the user interacts with the UI
//They are often used for complex and dynamic UI


//what is memory leak in react?
//A memory leak in react occures when a functional component that is
//no longer being used to continues to take up memory resources.
//this can lead to slow performances or crashes if the memory usage 
//continuous to increase over time


//How does rendering work in react (describe the lifecycle of functional component )

//A react component undergoes four phases in its life cycle //initialiazation //mounting
//updating and unmounting //

////Initialization: During this phase, React component will prepare by setting up the default
//props and initial state for the upcoming tough journey.

//1 mounting phase : when a new component is created and insearted into the dom
////or in other words when the life of a component begins .
// Updating: In this phase, a component will be updated when there is a change in the
// state or props of a component. This phase will have lifecycle methods
// like componentWillUpdate, shouldComponentUpdate, render, and componentDidUpdate.
// Unmounting: In this last phase of the component lifecycle, the component will be
// removed from the DOM or will be unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase will
// have the lifecycle method named componentWillUnmount.


// setState() that accepts a function rather than an object. That function
//  will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at 
//  the time the update is applied as the second argument:















































// Ans- useReducer is a hook that provides an alternative to using useState for
//  managing state in a React component. You can use useReducer when you have
//   state updates that are complex, have multiple related updates, or have 
//   updates that depend on previous state.
// For example, consider a form with multiple fields, each with its own state.
//  The state updates for one field might depend on the state of another field, 
//  so you would need to write custom logic to handle the updates. In such a case,
//   useReducer would be more appropriate than useState.
// Another use case for useReducer is when you need to perform complex updates 
// to the state. For example, if you need to calculate the next state based on the
//  current state, or if you need to update multiple pieces of state at once, 
//  useReducer can make your code more maintainable and easier to understand.
// So, in general, you should use useReducer when:
// . You need to handle complex state updates
// . You have multiple related updates to the state â€¢ Your updates depend 
// on previous state
// And, you should use useState when:
// You have simple state updates
// . Your updates don't depend on previous state You only need to update 
// a single piece of state.
// Note-A good example of using useReducer would be the implementation of a cart system
