//  . Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?
// No. HTML elements are defined by a starting tag, may contain some content and a
//  closing tag.For example, <h1>Heading 1</h1> is a HTML element but just <h1> 
//     is a starting tag and </h1> is a closing tag.

// What are tags and attributes in HTML?
// Tags are the primary component of the HTML that defines how the content will be
//  structured/ formatted, whereas Attributes are used along with 
//  the HTML tags to define the characteristics of the element. For example,
//   <p align=” center”>Interview questions</p>, in this the ‘align’ 
//is the attribute using which we will align the paragraph to show in the center aq=of the view.

//  What are void elements in HTML?
// HTML elements which do not have closing tags or do not need to be 
// closed are Void elements. For Example <br />, <img />, <hr />, etc.




// 5. What are HTML Entities?
// In HTML some characters are reserved like ‘<’, ‘>’, ‘/’, etc. To use these characters in
// our webpage we need to use the character entities called HTML Entities. Below are a
// few mapping between the reserved character and its respective entity character to be
// used.

// . What is the ‘class’ attribute in HTML?
// The class attribute is used to specify the class name for an HTML element. Multiple
// elements in HTML can have the same class value.

// What are the various formatting tags in HTML

// <b> - makes text bold
// <i> - makes text italic
// <em> - makes text italic but with added semantics importance
// <big> - increases the font size of the text by one unit
// <small> - decreases the font size of the text by one unit
// <sub> - makes the text a subscript
// <sup> - makes the text a superscript
// <del> - displays as strike out text
// <strong> - marks the text as important
// <mark> - highlights the text
// <ins> - displays as added text


    // The <strong> tag specifies the strong importance of the content.
    //      It can be used to highlight seriousness, 
    //     urgency, or importance. It indicates how something must be understood.

    // The <b> tag highlights in bold a part of the text to make
    //      it more obvious for the user.It is a style. It doesn’t convey any 
    //      additional importance.

    
      // The effect on a normal webpage of the tags <strong>, <b>  and <em>, <i> is the
// same. <b> and <i> tags stands for bold and italic. These two tags only apply font
// styling and bold tag <b>, just adds more ink to the text, these tags don't say
// anything about the text.





// A div is a block-level element and a span is an inline element.
// The div should be used to wrap sections of a document,
//  while use spans to wrap small portions of text, images, etc.
// div accepts align attribute but span do not


//viewPort
// The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page



// Whereas, <strong> and <em> tags represent that the span of text is of strong importance or 
// more importance and emphatic stress respectively
// than the rest of the text. These tags have semantic meaning.

    // 1 <head> tag in the entire Html document and will always be before the <body> tag.

// <body> tag defines the body of the HTML document. It should always be enclosed in the <html> tag.

// fixed: This is similar to absolute except here the elements are positioned
//  relative to the <html> element.

// relative: Here the element is positioned according to the normal flow 
// of the document and positioned relative to its original/ normal position.

// initial: This resets the property to its default value.

// inherit: Here the element inherits or takes the property of its parent.

//  hidden”, when used as attributes to the HTML element.

// element then that element will be hidden from the webpage but still

// an HTML element then the element will be hidden, and also it 
// won’t take up any space on the webpage.

//the same window or tab as it was clicked.

//  In how many ways can we specify the CSS styles for the HTML element?
// There are three ways in which we can specify the styles for HTML elements

// Inline: Here we use the ‘style’ attribute inside the HTML element.
// Internal: Here we use the <style> tag inside the <head> tag. 
//     To apply the style we bind the elements using ‘id’ or ‘class’ attributes.
// External: Here we use the <link> tag inside <head> tag to
//      reference the CSS file into our HTML code. 
//      Again the binding between elements and styles
//       is done using ‘id’ or ‘class’ attributes.
