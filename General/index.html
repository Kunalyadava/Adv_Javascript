    JavaScript Libraries vs. JavaSCript Frameworks
The main distinction between JavaScript libraries and 
frameworks is that libraries are made up of functions that an 
application can use to execute a task, whereas frameworks specify 
how an application is designed. In other words, rather than the other
 way around, the framework calls on the application code. Of course, 
 libraries are still required for developers to complete fundamental web
  operations with JavaScript. Even if you’re utilizing a framework, it’s
   still necessary to have a thorough command of Javascript.


   //Node JS 
   What is Node.js?
   NodeJS is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on top of Chrome’s 
   V8 JavaScript Engine enabling high performance and scalability. NodeJS uses the process model instead 
   of the traditional web server model, which makes it super useful for web development.
Advantages of Node.js
The popularity of Node.js can be attributed to a couple of stand-out advantages, some of them alluded to in the previous section.

Node.js is open-source meaning it has been made freely available to developers all over the world.
 Anyone is able to proposed modifications or improvements.
Using Node.js we are able to build entire server-side applications using only JavaScript.
The runtime environment itself is very lightweight. It includes only the core modules
 needed to function. Any other modules required by the application may be easily installed.
The asynchronous nature of Node.js leads to increased performance over other frameworks.
Node.js may be run on Windows, MAC, or Linux systems.
