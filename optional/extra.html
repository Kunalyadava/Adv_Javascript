Flux Architecture

<!-- Flux is an architectural pattern that was popularized by Facebook
 for building user interfaces, particularly in the context 
 of React applications. It provides a unidirectional data flow, 
 making it easier to manage state and handle complex application logic.

The key components of the Flux architecture are:

Dispatcher: Acts as the central hub for handling 
actions and dispatching them to registered callbacks.
It ensures that actions are processed in a predictable order.

Actions: Represent events or user interactions that occur
in the application. They are triggered by various sources,
such as UI components or server responses. Actions encapsulate
the data associated with the event and are sent to the dispatcher.

Stores: Stores contain the application state and business logic.
They respond to actions dispatched by the dispatcher and update
their data accordingly. Stores are responsible for managing the
state and exposing methods to retrieve data.
They emit change events to notify the views about updates.

Views (React Components): React components are responsible 
for rendering the user interface based on the application 
state stored in the stores. Views subscribe to store change
events and update themselves when notified.
They also trigger actions in response to user interactions.

The data flow in Flux follows a unidirectional path:
Actions flow into the dispatcher, which then triggers updates in the stores.
The stores update their state and emit change events. 
Views, listening to the change events, retrieve the updated state from 
the stores and re-render accordingly. User interactions trigger actions, continuing the cycle.

The Flux architecture promotes separation of concerns by 
clearly defining the responsibilities of each component. 
It helps in maintaining a predictable flow of data and 
enables better handling of complex application logic 
and state management, especially in large-scale React applications.

It's important to note that Flux itself is a pattern, 
and there are different Flux implementations available. 
The most common implementation is the original Flux 
library by Facebook, but there are also alternative 
libraries like Redux and MobX that provide similar 
unidirectional data flow patterns with their own variations and enhancements.
