    <!-- It is necessary to have the `target` property when 
        an event is fired. We can do the following with the `target` property of the event.

- Get the `element` that fired the event.
- Access the properties of the `element`.
- Modify some properties of the `element`, such as the CSS, the attributes, etc. -->
<p>
    Click on button in this document to find out which element triggered the
    onclick event.

  <button>This is a button</button>

  <p id="demo"></p>

  <script>
    document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", myFunction);
    function myFunction() {
      var x = event.target;
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
        "Triggered by a " + x.tagName + " element";

<!-- - `target`, is a property of an event which is a reference to the element upon which the event was fired. Just as 'target' means 'aiming at something', it's used to 'aim' at that particular element.
- This property gives us access to the properties of that element.
- Since the target property has given us access to the element, we could then read some of the properties (which are the attributes) and also display them somewhere else.

### **Syntax**

The `target` property can only be obtained if the event of an `element` is being listened to. -->
