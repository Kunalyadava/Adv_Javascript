    JavaScript Libraries vs. JavaSCript Frameworks
The main distinction between JavaScript libraries and 
frameworks is that libraries are made up of functions that an 
application can use to execute a task, whereas frameworks specify 
how an application is designed. In other words, rather than the other
 way around, the framework calls on the application code. Of course, 
 libraries are still required for developers to complete fundamental web
  operations with JavaScript. Even if you’re utilizing a framework, it’s
   still necessary to have a thorough command of Javascript.
