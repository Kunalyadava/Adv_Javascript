   //Node JS 
//    What is Node.js?
//    NodeJS is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on top of Chromeâ€™s 
//    V8 JavaScript Engine enabling high performance and scalability. NodeJS uses the process model instead 
//    of the traditional web server model, which makes it super useful for web development.
// Advantages of Node.js
// The popularity of Node.js can be attributed to a couple of stand-out advantages, some of them alluded to in the previous section.

// Node.js is open-source meaning it has been made freely available to developers all over the world.
//  Anyone is able to proposed modifications or improvements.
// Using Node.js we are able to build entire server-side applications using only JavaScript.
// The runtime environment itself is very lightweight. It includes only the core modules
//  needed to function. Any other modules required by the application may be easily installed.
// The asynchronous nature of Node.js leads to increased performance over other frameworks.
// Node.js may be run on Windows, MAC, or Linux systems.
