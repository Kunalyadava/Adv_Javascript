    // How are we creating Objects in Js?
// 1. Object Literal
// var a = { name : 'Batman' }

// But, to create multiple objects of the same type, the object literal 
// method is inefficient but we have a solution.
//  Constructor functions
// We can create objects in Js using functions as well.
// This is one example of creating an object using a function.

// What is this?
// In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object.

// Which object depends on how this is being invoked (used or called).

// The this keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used:

// In an object method, this refers to the object.
var person={
    name:"john",
    myName:function(){
        console.log(this.name) //this==person
    }
}

person.myName()

// Alone, this refers to the global object.
// In a function, this refers to the global object.
// In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
// In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
// Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.
